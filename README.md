# Shakespeare Text Generation



## Description

This repository contains code for generating text using Shakespeare's plays as a training dataset. The code utilizes TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, along with natural language processing techniques to produce new text based on a given prompt. By training on Shakespeare's works, the model learns patterns and structures prevalent in his writings and generates text that mimics his distinctive style. The program will analyze the text data, train the model, and then generate new text based on a given prompt.
