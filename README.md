# Text-Generation

# Repository Name

Shakespeare Text Generation

## Description

This repository contains code for generating text using Shakespeare's plays as a training dataset. The code uses TensorFlow for deep learning and natural language processing techniques to generate new text based on a given prompt.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shakespeare-text-generation.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install tensorflow numpy
   ```

3. Set the file path for the Shakespeare text data in the code:

   ```python
   file = '/path/to/shakespeare/text'
   ```

4. Run the code:

   ```python
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies and set the appropriate file path, you can run the `main.py` script to generate text. The generated text will be printed in the console.

You can modify the code to change the prompt or experiment with different hyperparameters to get different results.
